# INFO212 Simple React App - Random Beers and how to save them
This is a basic web application written in React.js.

The app takes in a random beer from an [open REST API of PUNK beers](https://punkapi.com/), it allows the user to save the random beers in a personal list that is saved in the browser. 

The code is commented, but if there are any questions send me a mail at: **edvard.bjorgen@uib.no**

**Prerequisites**: 
- NPM (Node Package Manager)
- Git 
- Very basic knowledge of command line interface

**Installation notes**:

1. First you have to clone the project, use a command line application ("Terminal" for macOS or "Command line prompt" in Windows) and open the command line in the folder where you want to download the project. 
  
2. When in the folder enter "git clone https://github.com/eddiman/INFO212-simple-react-app/"

3. When finished cloning, go in to the folder via the command line: "cd yourFoldername/"

4. Now you have to install the packages the project utilizes, enter "npm install". This'll take a couple of minutes.

5. When the installation of the packages is done, it's time to start the application, type in 'npm start' 

6. When this is finished (usually takes a minute or so), open up your favorite browser and go to "localhost:3000"

7. The app should start and you can find yourself a bunch of random PUNK beers.
